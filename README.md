## 5. Desk Reservation System (Divar)

The Java code implements a desk reservation system for a workspace with multiple floors and desks. Users can request and reserve desks based on specific criteria such as availability, features, and time intervals. The code can be further extended and customized to meet specific requirements and integrate with other systems or interfaces.

### Features:
The code reads input from the user to perform various actions. The available commands are as follows:

1. `request_desk <user> <required_type> <start_time> <duration>`: Requests a desk for a user with the specified requirements (required type, start time, and duration).
2. `reserve_desk <user> <reserve_start_time> <reserve_duration> <feature_code>`: Reserves a desk for a user with the specified features, start time, and duration.
3. `reserve_multiple_desks <user> <num_of_desks> <start_time> <duration>`: Reserves multiple desks for a user with the specified number of desks, start time, and duration.
4. desk_status <desk_id> <start_time>: Displays the status of a desk with the specified ID at the given start time.


## 6. Shopping Mall Management System
This is a Java program that simulates a shopping mall management system. It allows users to sign up or log in as administrators, producers, carriers, or clients, and perform various actions within the shopping mall.

### Features
1. `Admin Actions`
  - Add producers and carriers
  - View and edit producer and carrier information
  - Apply discounts to all products

2. `Producer Actions`
  - Add different types of products (Food, Wearing, Device)
  - Specify product details such as company name, volume, price, etc.

3. `Carrier Actions`
  - Set the type of vehicle (motorcycle, pickup, car)
  - Perform carrier-related tasks

4. `Client Actions`
  - Sign up as a client
  - Log in as a client
  - Perform client-specific tasks

### Usage

Upon running the program, you will be prompted with a menu displaying various options. Enter the corresponding number to select an option and proceed with the desired action. The menu allows you to sign up or log in as an admin, producer, carrier, or client, and perform tasks specific to each role.

Please note that this program is a simulation and does not have a graphical user interface (GUI). All interactions and outputs are performed through the command line.


## 7. Dice Kid
This is a game implemented for Game Jam 2022 using C# and Unity Engine. 
Only phase 1 of the game is completed. 
phase 2 including level generation and other mechanics will be added later. 
phase 3 including exported executable game will be added later.

### Features
1. Control Dice Mother using 'A', 'D', 'W' keys to go left, right and jump, respectively.
2. By colliding Dice Kids, Dice Mother collects them.
3. Each kid can be dropped using 'space' key. Then a new ability will be added, randomly, according to the random dice number of that kid.
4. By getting near an enemy, it will start following you.
5. By colliding an enemy, you will lose a kid, and if there are no kids you will lose a heart.
6. You have to reach the end line with maximum number of kids. Your Score will be calculated by that.
